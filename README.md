# Bandersnatch Monster Cards

### Business Value
- Created a Landing Page (as a lead magnet) to drive sales of Monster Cards - 52 card deck playing cards.

### What this is:
- Order a 52 card deck of Monster playing cards with more rare monsters as highest value. Ex a very rare Dragon might be the Ace of Diamonds.
- Originally, this was a Bloomtech Labs Data Science project centered on regression to predict Monster rarity.

	- Add AI created Monster images

### Development Challenges
1. Sprint 1:
	- Initial project setup: 
2. Sprint 2:
	- df
3. Sprint 3:
	- sdf
4. Sprint 4:
   	- sdf
5. Sprint 5:
   	- sfd

### General Development Procedure
1. Fully understand the requirements. Try to delete dumb ones.
2. Explore new libraries, methods in Google Colab Notebooks.
3. Write psuedocode comments of what I'm trying to accomplish.
4. Write class method minimal interfaces and attributes.
5. Write Pytest cases for those methods and attributes.
6. Code.
7. Iterate.

### Further Improvements
"Without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning." â€“ Benjamin Franklin

Here's what I would like to improve.

1. Better docstrings for the Machine class (docstrings in the Database class are textbook!)
2.

### BONUS! Potential Expansions in Business Value
1. Unique Monster Battle Card Game: Magic into being rules for a game where Monsters fight in armies as cards held in decks by players doing battle with one another. With magical attack, swords, armor and keeping track of health points and mana.
2. New Card Games: Expand to other standard card games: Monster Go Fish, Monster Pinochle, etc.
3. Digital Collectibles: Digital card images with downloaded NFTs to ensure uniqueness and rarity.
4. Real Item Collectibles: Printed cards with embedded RFID chips with noncopyable NFTs in them.
5. White Label Platform: Convert into a white label platform for creators to use to create card decks with any theme of AI created images and/or text on them.
