# Bandersnatch Monster Cards

### Business Value
- Created a Landing Page (as a lead magnet) to drive sales of Monster Cards - 52 card deck playing cards.

### What this is:
- Order a 52 card deck of Monster playing cards with more rare monsters as highest value. Ex a very rare Dragon might be the Ace of Diamonds.
- Originally, this was a Bloomtech Labs Data Science project centered on regression to predict Monster rarity.
